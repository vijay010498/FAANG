// - Online technical interview: graph exercises, trees.

// They asked me to carry out an encryption algorithm in a function in 30 minutes
// which was solved by applying a mathematical formula which I obviously did not know and was not allowed to Google.
//   I did it without the formula, creating an efficient and inefficient
//   function, clarifying my lack of knowledge regarding encryption algorithms and their optimization

// Approximately three technical exercises intermediate difficulty
// , algorithm to traverse array of nodes finding parent, root node,
// explaining with big O notation to explain the performance of the
// algorithm and find some way to make it more efficient
